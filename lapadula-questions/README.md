### Description

This Python script simulates a Bell-LaPadula environment by executing a command within a subprocess and handling its output interactively. The script is designed to dynamically parse security levels, categories, and evaluate Bell-LaPadula model queries from the output of the subprocess, making decisions based on these security rules.
