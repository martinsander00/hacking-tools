### Description

This program simulates a simplified Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshake process where the participant acts as the server. It's designed to demonstrate and provide hands-on experience with cryptographic operations involved in setting up a secure communication channel using TLS protocols.

### Features

Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange: Implements the Diffie-Hellman (DH) algorithm to securely exchange cryptographic keys over a public channel.

AES-128 Encrypted Communication: Utilizes AES-128 encryption to secure communication after key exchange.

Digital Signatures: Uses a self-signed root certificate to sign and verify user certificates, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the communication.
